## 🧠 Steps Followed
1. **Loaded dataset** using `pandas`
2. **Data inspection** using `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`
3. **Data visualization** using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
   - Pairplots and heatmaps to show correlations
   - Histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to reveal distributions and trends
4. **Findings summarized** in a professional EDA report (PDF)

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Engagement** and **Satisfaction** are positively correlated  
- **Salary** distribution is right-skewed (majority earn under 100k)  
- Outliers in salary likely represent **senior management**  
- **Absences** show weak correlation with engagement and performance
